# GigHub Mapbox
### Overview

[**GigHub MapBox**](http://bywallace.github.io/gighub-mapbox/) is a map-based implementation of [**GigHub**](http://gighubdc.herokuapp.com/). Events for the current day are both marked on the map and listed on the sidebar. Clicking a listing will pan/zoom the map to the venue. The listings are generated by the user's geocoordinates, provided they allow the browser to access their current location. It was built over one day as a mapping learning exercise and re-imagining of what GigHub could be.

### Technologies Used

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
